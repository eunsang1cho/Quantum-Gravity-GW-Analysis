# Project Summary: Black Hole Ringdown Quantum Search

## One-Page Overview

**Question:** Do black holes show quantum gravitational effects in their ringdown?

**Answer:** No evidence found.

---

### The Journey

**Phase 1:** Initial 3 events showed perfect +3% deviation → Excited!  
**Phase 2:** Real data on 44 events → Messy, inconclusive  
**Phase 3:** Added spin corrections → Even messier  
**Phase 4:** Focused on best event (GW170818) → +10.5% but isolated  

**Final verdict:** NULL result

---

### Key Finding: GW170818

One perfect event:
- Mass: 59 M☉ (predicted range)
- Orientation: 90° edge-on (minimal spin)
- Result: +10.50% ± 0.65% (16σ!)

**But:** Not reproduced in GW150914 (same mass range, -12% instead)

---

### Why It Failed

1. **Spin effects dominate** (20%) vs quantum (3%)
2. **Only 2 events** in target range with spin data
3. **No reproducibility** (50% success = random)
4. **Systematics > signal** by factor of 7

**Bottom line:** Unfeasible with current data

### What We Learned

✓ Gravitational wave analysis methods  
✓ Statistical hypothesis testing  
✓ Importance of negative results  
✓ How to report null findings  
✓ Computational reproducibility

### Materials Provided

- Complete Python code (all phases)
- Full analysis results (CSV)
- Detailed methodology
- Honest lessons learned
- This README you're reading

---

### Scientific Value

**Traditional view:** Failed experiment = wasted time  
**Modern view:** Documented negative result = valuable contribution

This project:
- Shows what doesn't work
- Prevents others from repeating
- Demonstrates realistic research
- Provides learning materials

### For Future Researchers

**Don't try this with current data.** Need either:
- 100× more events, or
- 10× better systematics, or
- Different approach

**Wait for LIGO O5** (~2027) then reassess.

### Bottom Line

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Hypothesis** | Quantum effects at 59-62 M☉ |
| **Prediction** | +3% frequency shift |
| **Observed** | +10.5% (1 event), -12% (1 event) |
| **p-value** | 0.96 (consistent with zero) |
| **Conclusion** | **NULL** |
| **Confidence** | 95% |
