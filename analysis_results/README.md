Generated: 2026-02-04 00:02:58

## Summary
- Total events analyzed: 5
- Combined significance: 0.45σ
- Interpretation: NO EVIDENCE for quantum effects

## Files in this directory:
- `analysis_report.txt`: Detailed text report with statistics
- `multi_event_summary.png`: Summary plots for all events
- `analysis_results.json`: Machine-readable results
- `<event>_time_frequency.png`: Individual event time-frequency plots
- `<event>_<detector>_processed.npz`: Processed strain data

## How to interpret:
1. Check combined significance in `analysis_report.txt`
2. Look at `multi_event_summary.png` for visual overview
3. Examine individual event plots for anomalies
4. Compare with theoretical predictions in report

## Next steps:
- If significance < 3σ: No evidence for quantum effects
- If 3σ < significance < 5σ: Interesting but needs confirmation
- If significance > 5σ: Either new physics or systematic error!

## Theory:
This analysis searched for quantum gravity signatures in black hole
ringdown, specifically testing the "Gravitational Lattice Stretching"
hypothesis that predicts frequency anomalies due to Planck-scale
spatial cutoffs near the event horizon.
